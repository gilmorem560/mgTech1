Basics of scene graphing in place along with some graphics and input support

No physics currently, need to devise a collision scheme

No sound beyond initialization of an ALSA PCM device

Input only has a few keys actually hooked up, no control abstraction yet

No fileio, fileio planned for save files, network traffic, etc...

Current application is just a triangle that moves with WSAD, exit with Q

Planned features in no particular order:
	Graphics abstraction, currently all code is X11+OpenGL but working
		on a common interface for other APIs
	Audio abstraction, currently all code is ALSA
	True models with bones and stuff, learning blender concurrently
	Complex parent-child node relationships for animations/following
	Heightmap-driven stage collision
	Additional debug rendering, displaying bounding-boxes, etc.
		Use of said rendering for tool design w/ fixed camera
